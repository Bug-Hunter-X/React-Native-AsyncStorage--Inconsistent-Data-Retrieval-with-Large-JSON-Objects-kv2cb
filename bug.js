This React Native bug manifests when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data, especially large JSON objects.  The issue arises when attempting to retrieve the data; the retrieved value is often incomplete or truncated, leading to unexpected behavior in the application.  This is especially apparent when dealing with nested JSON structures. The problem is not consistent; sometimes the data retrieves correctly, other times it's corrupted. This inconsistency makes debugging extremely difficult.

```javascript
// In a component's function
const getData = async () => {
  try {
    const jsonValue = await AsyncStorage.getItem('@my_storage_key');
    const data = jsonValue != null ? JSON.parse(jsonValue) : null;
    // ... process the data
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('Failed to retrieve data:', e);
  }
};
```
